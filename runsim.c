/**
 * Implement 'runsim' as follows:
 * 1. Check CLI arguments and output a usage message if argument is not appropriate
 * 2. Allocate shared memory and populate it with the number of licenses from Step 1
 * 3. Execute the main loop until stdin is end-of-file is reached on stdin
 *  a. Read a line from stdin of up to MAX_CANON characters (fgets)
 *  b. Request a license from the License object
 *  c. Fork a child that does 'docommand'. docommand will request a license from the license manager object.
 *      Notice that if the license is not available, the request function will go into wait state.
 *  d. Pass the input string from step (a) to docommand. The docommand function will execl the specified command
 *  e. The parent (runsim) checks to see if any of the children have finished (waitpid with WNOHANG option).
 *      It will `returnlicense` when that happens
 *  f. After encountering EOF on stdin, `wait` for all the remaining children to finish and then exit
